When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more
